# TTS Events [&#8681;](tts-events.plugin.js)
Plays Ventrilo-like text-to-speech messages when a user connects to voice, disconnects from voice, joins the channel, or leaves the channel. You can change the voice (only ones installed on your system), volume, speech, pitch, and the messages themselves.

# AFK Auto-Deafen [&#8681;](afk-deafen.plugin.js)
Automatically deafens Discord when you enter an AFK channel, and undeafens when you leave one. You tell it which channel names are AFK channels.

# Latency Display [&#8681;](latency.plugin.js)
Displays a live ping on the 'Connection Info' button. You can change which server is pinged, how often, and set thresholds at which to display the ping as yellow, orange, or red.

# Auto-Select Server [&#8681;](auto-select-server.plugin.js)
When Discord starts up, this plugin will select the server that you're speaking in automatically.
